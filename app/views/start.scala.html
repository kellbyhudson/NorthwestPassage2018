<h1>Let the adventure begin</h1>
<p>You have been chosen by the Queen of Westeros to find a northern water way to China to acquire much needed fidget spinners.
    You are given a small ship with a crew of 10 people.
    Most of your sailor friends believe that your best chance of success is to sail northwest above Kings Landing.
    However, some of your crew believe you should try going east over Dragonstone or north over the top of the Wall instead.
